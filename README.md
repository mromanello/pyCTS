## pyCTS

Author: Matteo Romanello, <matteo.romanello@gmail.com>

pyCTS is an initial pythonic implementation of the CTS API. The support is currently limited to the `CTS_URN` class which allows one to perform basic operation on CTS URNs, i.e. the kind of URNs defined and used by the [CTS protocol](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/texts/ctsoverview.html) and the [CITE architecture](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-doc/cite/). 

The current implementation is basically a port to python of [this CTS Java implementation](https://bitbucket.org/neelsmith/cts) by Neel Smith.
